Hi! 

Im Jakob Sachs, currently a Bachelor Student , studying [Computing In Science (_Physics_) ](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/studies/bachelor/cis.html)
at the [University of Hamburg](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/).

I made this Blog motivated by Kev Quirk (from _startafuckingblog.com_), with the plan to post about whatever catches my current interest. Some of those include:


- Low Level/High Performance Computing
- Functional Languages (especially Haskell)
- Particle / Quantum Physics
- Good Visualizations, which are way to rare for any subject in my experience
- (sometimes Math ðŸ‘€)

My socials should be linked at the bottom.
